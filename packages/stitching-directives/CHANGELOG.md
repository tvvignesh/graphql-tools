# @graphql-tools/stitching-directives

## 1.3.1

### Patch Changes

- d7b4e09e: fix(stitching-directives): to allow keys to include lists

## 1.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 24926654: Deprecates the `MergeTypeConfig.computedFields` setting (with backwards-compatible warning) in favor of new computed field configuration written as:

  ```js
  merge: {
    MyType: {
      fields: {
        myComputedField: {
          selectionSet: '{ weight }',
          computed: true,
        }
      }
    }
  }
  ```

  A field-level `selectionSet` specifies field dependencies while the `computed` setting structures the field in a way that assures it is always selected with this data provided. The `selectionSet` is intentionally generic to support possible future uses. This new pattern organizes all field-level configuration (including `canonical`) into a single structure.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [24926654]
  - @graphql-tools/delegate@7.0.10

## 1.2.0

### Minor Changes

- d9b82a2e: enhance(stitch) canonical merged type and field definitions. Use the @canonical directive to promote preferred type and field descriptions into the combined gateway schema.

  - @graphql-tools/delegate@7.0.9

## 1.1.2

### Patch Changes

- 6e50d9fc: enhance(stitching-directives): use keyField

  When using simple keys, i.e. when using the keyField argument to `@merge`, the keyField can be added implicitly to the types's key. In most cases, therefore, `@key` should not be required at all.
